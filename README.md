## Hello there! 👋 You can call me... Srini!

> My personal quest in life is to be a polymath, on the foundation of being a good husband, patient father and kind human being.

### Design Engineering + Design Systems + Dev Experience + Community + Evangelism 🧑🏽‍💻
#### Profession, Craft and Passion.❣️ Tech + Art. 
The above sums up where my head is at and what matters most to me.

I live in Austin, TX with my wife, son and a canine kid 🐾.

🌱 I’m currently noodling with Next.JS and curious about NFTs.
