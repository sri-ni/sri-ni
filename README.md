## Hello there! 👋 You can call me... Srini!

> My personal quest in life is to be a polymath, on the foundation of being a good husband, patient father and kind human being.

### Design Engineering + Design Systems + Dev Experience + Community + Evangelism 🧑🏽‍💻
#### Profession, Craft and Passion.❣️ Tech + Art. 
The above sums up where my head is at and what matters most to me.

- Experienced in leading Product Design System & Design Engineering teams.
- Built component libraries in HTML, CSS, Angular & React.
- Used Sketch, Invision and Figma to craft our Design Language.
- Been through the maturity cycle of a Design System from genesis to 3+ years & 4+ versions.
- Built Dev Experience and Community around the Assets.

The above is ongoing, as I continue to influence and evangelise individuals, teams and communities.
